This is the README file for a simple dice game that I've created in the fall semester of 2023 in my CSCI 251 class, the code is not optimal but it does run.

1) Type a number between 1 - 6 in the box and click roll
2) If correct you gain $3
3) If wrong you lose $1
4) Still working on fixing the loop to auto clear the box so you don't have to empty it yourself and can immmediately type in your next guess

Comments and changes of the lines of code are more than welcome to improve gameplay/optimize for better performance
